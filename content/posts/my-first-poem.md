The sun rises in the morning sky,
Birds are singing, flying high.
I wake up with a happy smile,
Ready to walk another mile.

The grass is green, the flowers bloom,
Colors chase away the gloom.
I take a breath of fresh, clean air,
Life is beautiful everywhere.

Friends will laugh and play with me,
Together we are strong and free.
Every day brings something new,
Dreams can come if we stay true.
