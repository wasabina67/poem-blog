Weekends are like a breath of fresh air after a busy week.
You don't need to book a long holiday to feel recharged.
A weekend trip can be as simple as catching a local train or driving to a nearby town.
For example, if you live in Tokyo, you might hop on the JR line to Kamakura.
Spend the morning at a temple, enjoy matcha ice cream in the afternoon, and head home by dinner.

Sometimes it helps to plan loosely.
Make a list of two or three spots—maybe a riverside park, a small café you read about online, and a bookstore with used novels.
Start early on Saturday, and you'll have time for each place without rushing.
On Sunday, try a new recipe with fresh ingredients from a farmers' market before returning home.

A weekend escape works like a reset button.
By Sunday evening, you'll feel ready to tackle Monday with new energy.
Remember, the best trips are the ones that leave you smiling, not stressed.
Pack light, stay curious, and let the weekend lead the way!
