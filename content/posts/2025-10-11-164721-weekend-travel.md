I love weekend travel.
It is fun and easy.
You see new places.
You feel fresh.

Plan one or two days.
Pick a close place.
Take a train or a bus.
Drive for one hour.
Visit a park or beach.
Walk in the town.
Try a small cafe.

Pack light.
Bring water and snacks.
Carry a map or phone.
Wear good shoes.
Bring a rain jacket if needed.

Example one.
Go to the beach by train.
Bring a towel and sun cream.
Eat an ice cream.

Example two.
Visit a nearby city.
See a museum or a market.
Try local food for lunch.

Talk to people.
Ask for directions or tips.
Use simple English.
Say hello and thank you.

Weekend travel is good for English practice.
You meet new people and learn words.
Start small and enjoy.

Take photos to remember the trip.
Make a simple plan before you go.
Check the weather the day before.
Rest well and have fun.
